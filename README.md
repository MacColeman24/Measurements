# Measurements

This is a simple program that models a few different kinds of measurements. It has classes that represent weight, time, and length. Each class has methods for addition, accessors and mutators, and other utility methods. Class `Measurements` runs a simple test program for each of the three classes, but each class also has a `main` method which has more thorough tests of the class' methods.
